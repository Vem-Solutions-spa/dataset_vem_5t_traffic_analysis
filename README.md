#01_Process_dataset

This is the notebook to be run to apply the existing model to a dataset of one's own choice. The dataset has to be a csv file in the same folder, with columns in the same order as provided during the Big Dive.
Apart from that, one can just run each cell one after the other to build the dataset and apply the already trained model on it

#02_Exploratory_analysis

The name is strange but this is the (cleaned) notebook that we used to create the model during our project. Each important step has a comment and the notebook can be easy explored thanks to the many text cells.
The only requirement is to have the csv file for january 2018 (as provided for Big Dive) in the same folder where you run the notebook

The trained model can be found at this Drive link because it was too large https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oe2azKSU1XON6B-UFF7ahxip_IpiZnm9?usp=sharing
